# Factors

This Python script allows users to find **all the factors** of a number they input. A factor is a number that divides another number completely without leaving a remainder.

## 💡 What It Does

- Prompts the user to enter an integer.
- Iterates from 1 to the entered number.
- Checks which numbers divide the input value exactly.
- Prints all such numbers (factors).

## 📁 File

- `factors.py`: Contains the logic to compute and display the factors.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python factors.py
